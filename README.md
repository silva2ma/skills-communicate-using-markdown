# 🌐 WEB DEVELOPMENT COURSE

_Master the essentials of modern web development with hands-on projects and clear, practical guidance.
From beginner to builder — turn ideas into fully functional websites._

Step 1: Set Up Your GitHub Repository
The first step is always the hardest — so let's make it easy!

Create a new repository on GitHub.

Give it a short and clear name like web-dev-course.

Check "Add a README file" so people understand what your project is about.

(Optional but helpful) Add a .gitignore for Node or Visual Studio Code if you're using them.

Choose a license — we recommend the MIT License.
